# Rule

`AllowAny` on a DRF view lets unauthenticated callers use every action the
view exposes, including create, update, and delete.

# Satisfies

- [CC6.1 — Logical Access](../controls/cc6.1.md)

# Enforced at

- Semgrep in CI, using the vendored ruleset in `policies/semgrep/`

# Remediation

Replace `AllowAny` with an authenticated permission class (for example
`IsAuthenticated`, or `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` for public reads).
