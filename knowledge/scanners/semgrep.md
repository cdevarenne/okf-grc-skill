# Covers

Pattern-based static analysis of the Python source, using the vendored ruleset
in `policies/semgrep/` so results are offline and reproducible.

# Evidences

- [CC6.1 — Logical Access](../controls/cc6.1.md)
- [CC7.1 — Vulnerability Detection](../controls/cc7.1.md)

# Rules

Rule-to-control declarations live on guardrail concepts, for example
[DRF writes require authentication](../policies/drf-authenticated-writes.md).
