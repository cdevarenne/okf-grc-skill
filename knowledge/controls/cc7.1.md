# Intent

Known vulnerabilities across the software supply chain are detected before
they can be exploited: source, third-party dependencies, and container images.

# NIST SP 800-53 mapping

- **RA-5** — Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning
- **SI-2** — Flaw Remediation

# Evidenced by

- [Trivy](../scanners/trivy.md) — dependency and image CVEs
- [Semgrep](../scanners/semgrep.md) — static analysis

# Applies to

- [Sample Django / DRF API](../stack/django-api.md)
- [Container image](../stack/container.md)
