- [DRF writes require authentication](../policies/drf-authenticated-writes.md)

# Evidenced by

- [Semgrep](../scanners/semgrep.md) — authorization rules in application code

# Applies to

- [Sample Django / DRF API](../stack/django-api.md)
- [Container image](../stack/container.md)
- [Kubernetes manifests](../stack/k8s.md)
