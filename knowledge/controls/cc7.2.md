# Intent

Running workloads are monitored so anomalies and attacks are detected and
acted on.

# NIST SP 800-53 mapping

- **SI-4** — System Monitoring
- **AU-6** — Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting

# Evidenced by

No scanner in this bundle evidences runtime monitoring. A runtime detection
tool is planned for a later version, so this control is reported as
not assessed rather than as having no violations.

# Applies to

- [Kubernetes manifests](../stack/k8s.md)
