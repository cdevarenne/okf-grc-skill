What is deployed is exactly what was reviewed: artifacts are pinned and
changes pass automated policy gates before release.

# NIST SP 800-53 mapping

- **CM-2** — Baseline Configuration
- **CM-3** — Configuration Change Control

# Satisfied by

- [Deny :latest image tag](../policies/deny-latest-tag.md)

- [Checkov](../scanners/checkov.md) — IaC policy scan
- [Trivy](../scanners/trivy.md) — `:latest` image-tag check
